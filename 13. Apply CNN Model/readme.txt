In this exercise we are going to apply a pretrained cnn model 
for detecting a number of objects. So these are the motherfucking steps ya'll:

1. Load a model from disk
2. Pre-process an input image
3. Pass the image through the network and obtain the output classifications

We will be using ImageNet dataset for this work.
