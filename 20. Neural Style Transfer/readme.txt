The program neural style transfer.py transfers the style of a painting to youtr photos. 
The method used here is described in the Johnson et al. (2016) paper on faster neural transfer. While the Johnson et al. method is certainly fast, the biggest downside is that you cannot arbitrarily select your style images like you could in the Gatys et al. method which was the primary inspiration for the Johnson et al.

The program takes in a model (not included on the repository yet) and makes a forward push to the input image. I will be creating my own model for transferring Rohit's style of doodling on images.
